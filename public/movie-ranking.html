<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time!</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Jurrasic Park</h3>
<p>Overall great character development and storytelling.</p>
<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>Strong leading character and practical effects that are still believable and visually appealing even today.</p>
<h3>Tremors</h3>
<p>A movie I feel doesn't get enough credit for the excellent storytelling that it offers.</p>
